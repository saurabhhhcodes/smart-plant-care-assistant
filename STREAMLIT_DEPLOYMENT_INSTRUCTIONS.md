# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Instructions

This guide will help you deploy the Smart Plant Care Assistant application to Streamlit Cloud using your GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. A Streamlit Cloud account (free to sign up at https://streamlit.io/cloud)

## Repository Structure Preparation

Before deploying to Streamlit Cloud, ensure your repository has the correct structure:

```
smart-plant-care-assistant/
├── app.py                 # Main Streamlit application (deployment version)
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies for deployment
├── .streamlit/
│   └── config.toml       # Streamlit configuration
├── .env.example          # Environment variables template
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── plant_analysis.py     # Plant analysis utilities
├── full_plant_agent.py   # Full plant agent implementation
└── cleanup.ps1           # Cleanup script
```

## Required File Modifications

### 1. Main Application File

For Streamlit Cloud deployment, use `app_deploy.py` as your main application file since it's designed to work without Ollama dependencies. You can either:

- Rename `app_deploy.py` to `app.py`, or
- Keep both files and specify `app_deploy.py` as the main file in Streamlit Cloud

### 2. Requirements.txt

Update `requirements.txt` to only include dependencies needed for the deployment version:

```txt
streamlit>=1.32.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
Pillow>=10.0.0
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0.74
numpy>=1.24.0
requests>=2.31.0
```

Remove these dependencies as they are not needed for deployment:
- langchain>=0.1.0
- langchain-community>=0.0.10
- langchain-core>=0.1.0
- ollama>=0.1.5
- langgraph>=0.0.15
- pydantic>=2.5.0

## GitHub Repository Preparation

1. Create a new GitHub repository or use your existing repository
2. Push all necessary files to the repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Smart Plant Care Assistant for Streamlit Cloud"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/smart-plant-care-assistant.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud and sign in with your GitHub account
2. Click "New app"
3. Select your repository from the dropdown
4. Set the main file path to:
   - `smart-plant-care-assistant/app.py` (if you renamed the deployment file)
   - `smart-plant-care-assistant/app_deploy.py` (if keeping both files)
5. Click "Deploy!"

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment is complete:

1. Visit your application URL (usually in the format `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`)
2. Test all features:
   - Camera analysis
   - Photo upload
   - Chat interface
   - Care library
3. Verify that the application works correctly without any errors

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies in requirements.txt are correctly specified
2. **OpenCV Issues**: The deployment version uses opencv-python-headless which is compatible with Streamlit Cloud
3. **File Not Found Errors**: Ensure all necessary files are in the repository and paths are correct
4. **Memory Issues**: The deployment version uses simplified algorithms to minimize resource usage

## Updating Your Deployment

To update your deployed application:

1. Make changes to your local files
2. Commit and push to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update application"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. In Streamlit Cloud, click "Deploy" on your app to redeploy with the latest changes

## Additional Notes

- The deployment version uses mock agents instead of Ollama for AI processing
- All plant analysis is done using computer vision techniques with OpenCV
- The chat interface provides pre-defined responses based on keywords
- Care recommendations are stored as static data rather than generated by an AI model

Enjoy your deployed Smart Plant Care Assistant!
