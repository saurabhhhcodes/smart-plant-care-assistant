This document summarizes how to deploy the Smart Plant Care Assistant application using GitHub CLI and Streamlit CLI with your GitHub username "saurabhhhcodes".

## Files Created for Deployment

1. `streamlit_app.py` - Main Streamlit application (based on app_deploy.py)
2. `plant_analysis.py` - Plant analysis utilities
3. `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for deployment
4. `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
5. `.env.example` - Environment variables template
6. `deploy.sh` - Bash deployment script for Linux/Mac
7. `deploy.bat` - Batch deployment script for Windows

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
3. Authenticate with GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`

### Using the Deployment Scripts

#### For Linux/Mac:
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

#### For Windows:
```cmd
deploy.bat
```

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   ```bash
   gh repo create saurabhhhcodes/smart-plant-care-assistant --public --clone
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory and copy all files:
   ```bash
   cd smart-plant-care-assistant
   # Copy all necessary files to this directory
   ```

3. Add, commit, and push files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Smart Plant Care Assistant for Streamlit Cloud"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud:
   - Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository: `saurabhhhcodes/smart-plant-care-assistant`
   - Set the main file path to `streamlit_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy!"

## Application Features

The deployed application includes:

1. **Camera Analysis**: Real-time plant health monitoring using your device's camera
2. **Photo Upload**: Analyze plant images from your device
3. **AI Chat Assistant**: Get plant care advice through a chat interface
4. **Care Library**: Access care guides for common houseplants

## Requirements

The application requires the following Python packages:
- streamlit>=1.32.0
- python-dotenv>=1.0.0
- Pillow>=10.0.0
- opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0.74
- numpy>=1.24.0
- requests>=2.31.0

These are all included in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Testing the Application Locally

Before deploying, you can test the application locally:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Updating the Deployed Application

To update your deployed application:

1. Make changes to your local files
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update application"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Redeploy from Streamlit Cloud

## Notes

- The deployment version uses mock agents instead of Ollama for AI processing
- All plant analysis is done using computer vision techniques with OpenCV
- The chat interface provides pre-defined responses based on keywords
- Care recommendations are stored as static data rather than generated by an AI model

Enjoy your deployed Smart Plant Care Assistant!
