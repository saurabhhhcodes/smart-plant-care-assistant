# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]
- UI logic: No API key required for 'local-hf' and 'ollama' providers; status and warnings are now clear for open source LLMs.
- Provider integration: All major and open source LLMs supported, including local TinyLlama and Ollama.
- Chat agent: UTF-8 robust, context-aware, and error-handling improved.
- README: Updated to reflect all provider options and usage instructions.
