# Deployment Test Plan

This document outlines the steps to verify that the Smart Plant Care Assistant application is properly configured for Streamlit Cloud deployment.

## File Structure Verification

### Required Files
- [ ] `app.py` or `app_deploy.py` (main application file)
- [ ] `requirements.txt` (with correct dependencies)
- [ ] `.streamlit/config.toml` (Streamlit configuration)
- [ ] `.env.example` (environment variables template)
- [ ] `plant_analysis.py` (plant analysis utilities)
- [ ] `README.md` (project documentation)

### File Content Verification

#### Main Application File (`app_deploy.py`)
- [ ] Imports only necessary modules (streamlit, PIL, cv2, numpy, etc.)
- [ ] Uses MockPlantCareAgent instead of Ollama-based agent
- [ ] Uses SimplePlantAnalyzer instead of full analyzer
- [ ] All features work without external AI services
- [ ] No references to Ollama or langchain dependencies

#### Requirements.txt
- [ ] Only includes necessary dependencies:
  - [ ] streamlit>=1.32.0
  - [ ] python-dotenv>=1.0.0
  - [ ] Pillow>=10.0.0
  - [ ] opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0.74
  - [ ] numpy>=1.24.0
  - [ ] requests>=2.31.0
- [ ] Does NOT include:
  - [ ] ollama
  - [ ] langchain
  - [ ] langchain-community
  - [ ] langchain-core
  - [ ] langgraph
  - [ ] pydantic

## Feature Testing

### Camera Analysis
- [ ] Camera input works correctly
- [ ] Image processing functions without errors
- [ ] Plant health analysis displays properly
- [ ] Color analysis works with OpenCV
- [ ] Results display in user-friendly format

### Photo Upload
- [ ] File uploader accepts JPG, JPEG, PNG files
- [ ] Image display works correctly
- [ ] Analysis button triggers processing
- [ ] Results display properly

### Chat Interface
- [ ] Chat messages display correctly
- [ ] User input field works
- [ ] Mock responses return appropriately
- [ ] Conversation history maintained

### Care Library
- [ ] Plant selection dropdown works
- [ ] Care guide display functions
- [ ] Information shows for all plant types

## Dependency Testing

### Streamlit Components
- [ ] st.camera_input() works
- [ ] st.file_uploader() works
- [ ] st.chat_input() works
- [ ] st.selectbox() works
- [ ] All st.* components used in app function correctly

### External Libraries
- [ ] PIL/Pillow can open and process images
- [ ] OpenCV can process images
- [ ] NumPy can handle array operations
- [ ] Requests library available (though not heavily used in deployment version)

## Environment Testing

### Configuration Files
- [ ] .streamlit/config.toml loads correctly
- [ ] Environment variables can be loaded from .env (if present)

### Session State
- [ ] Session state variables initialize correctly
- [ ] State persists across interactions
- [ ] No session-related errors

## Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
- [ ] Application doesn't exceed Streamlit Cloud memory limits
- [ ] Image processing doesn't cause memory leaks
- [ ] Large images handled appropriately

### Processing Time
- [ ] Analysis completes within reasonable time
- [ ] No timeouts during processing
- [ ] User feedback provided during processing

## Error Handling

### Input Validation
- [ ] Invalid images handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing files handled appropriately
- [ ] User errors display helpful messages

### Exception Handling
- [ ] Try/catch blocks in place for critical operations
- [ ] Error messages user-friendly
- [ ] Application doesn't crash on exceptions

## Deployment Verification

### GitHub Repository
- [ ] All necessary files committed
- [ ] No unnecessary files included
- [ ] README.md provides clear instructions
- [ ] .gitignore excludes appropriate files

### Streamlit Cloud Configuration
- [ ] Main file path correctly specified
- [ ] Python version compatible
- [ ] Dependencies install without errors
- [ ] Application starts without errors

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Live Application
- [ ] Application accessible via URL
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] Loading times acceptable

### User Experience
- [ ] Interface intuitive and user-friendly
- [ ] Instructions clear
- [ ] Results presented clearly
- [ ] No broken UI elements

## Success Criteria

The deployment configuration is considered successful when:
1. All verification checks pass
2. The application runs without errors in Streamlit Cloud
3. All core features function as expected
4. Performance is acceptable for users
5. No dependency conflicts occur during deployment
